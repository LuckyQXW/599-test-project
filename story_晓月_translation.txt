Xiaoyue was a little girl, so excited about the arrival of the Spring Festival and the Chinese New Year.

Before the festival, she and her friends are preparing for a wonderful Spring Festival. They all bought firecrackers to celebrate the arrival of the new year.

During the Spring Festival, Xiaoyue and her friends also attended various activities, such as fireworks, mahjong, New Year's Eve dinner and gifts exchange.

Although these fun activities are many, the most important thing is the appearance of the Year Beast. When people start to set off firecrackers, the mysterious Year Beast will appear, bringing lots of gifts.

Xiaoyue and her friends were very happy. Soon they opened their gifts and found a cute little bear for Xiaoyue. It was a surprise from the Year Beast.

Xiaoyue was very happy and glad to have such a mysterious friend that could give her gifts and make her have a wonderful Spring Festival.
